 abstract = {Ring signatures are cryptographic protocols designed to allow any member of a group to produce a signature on behalf of the group, without revealing the individual signer's identity. This offers group members a level of anonymity not attainable through generic digital signature schemes. We call this property 'plausible deniability', or anonymity with respect to an anonymity set. We concentrate in particular on implementing privacy on the blockchain, introducing a unique ring signature scheme that works with existing blockchain systems. We implement a unique ring signature (URS) scheme using secp256k1, creating the first implementation compatible with blockchain libraries in this way, so as for easy implementation as an Ethereum smart contract. We review the privacy and security properties offered by the scheme we have constructed, and compare its efficiency with other commonly suggested approaches to privacy on the blockchain.},

@misc{Miller.2017,
 abstract = {Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, as deployed today, cannot scale for wide-spread use. A leading approach for cryptocurrency scaling is a smart contract mechanism called a payment channel which enables two mutually distrustful parties to transact efficiently (and only requires a single transaction in the blockchain to set-up). Payment channels can be linked together to form a payment network, such that payments between any two parties can (usually) be routed through the network along a path that connects them. Crucially, both parties can transact without trusting hops along the route.  In this paper, we propose a novel variant of payment channels, called Sprites, that reduces the worst-case {\textquotedbl}collateral cost{\textquotedbl} that each hop along the route may incur. The benefits of Sprites are two-fold. 1) In Lightning Network, a payment across a path of $\ell$ channels requires locking up collateral for {\$}$\backslash$Theta($\backslash$ell$\backslash$Delta){\$} time, where {\$}$\backslash$Delta{\$} is the time to commit an on-chain transaction. Sprites reduces this cost to {\$}O($\backslash$ell + $\backslash$Delta){\$}. 2) Unlike prior work, Sprites supports partial withdrawals and deposits, during which the channel can continue to operate without interruption.  In evaluating Sprites we make several additional contributions. First, our simulation-based security model is the first formalism to model timing guarantees in payment channels. Our construction is also modular, making use of a generic abstraction from folklore, called the {\textquotedbl}state channel,{\textquotedbl} which we are the first to formalize. We also provide a simulation framework for payment network protocols, which we use to confirm that the Sprites construction mitigates against throughput-reducing attacks.},

@misc{Wang.2018,
 abstract = {Existing data storage systems offer a wide range of functionalities to accommodate an equally diverse range of applications. However, new classes of applications have emerged, e.g., blockchain and collaborative analytics, featuring data versioning, fork semantics, tamper-evidence or any combination thereof. They present new opportunities for storage systems to efficiently support such applications by embedding the above requirements into the storage.  In this paper, we present ForkBase, a storage engine specifically designed to provide efficient support for blockchain and forkable applications. By integrating the core application properties into the storage, ForkBase not only delivers high performance but also reduces development effort. Data in ForkBase is multi-versioned, and each version uniquely identifies the data content and its history. Two variants of fork semantics are supported in ForkBase to facilitate any collaboration workflows. A novel index structure is introduced to efficiently identify and eliminate duplicate content across data objects. Consequently, ForkBase is not only efficient in performance, but also in space requirement. We demonstrate the performance of ForkBase using three applications: a blockchain platform, a wiki engine and a collaborative analytics application. We conduct extensive experimental evaluation of these applications against respective state-of-the-art system. The results show that ForkBase achieves superior performance while significantly lowering the development cost.},

@misc{RanchalPedrosa.2020,
 abstract = {The long-standing impossibility of reaching agreement restricts the lifespan of blockchains. In fact, the consensus on a block to be appended to any blockchain succeeds either with some probability or at the condition that two thirds of the $n$ replicas are not Byzantine. In the former case, the probability that the blockchain fails grows exponentially with the number of newly appended blocks. In the latter case, the blockchain fails as soon as a coalition bribes {\$}f=n/3{\$} replicas. As a result, one may wonder whether blockchains are doomed to fail.  In this paper, we answer this question in the negative by proposing the first Longlasting Blockchain system, \emph{LLB}. LLB builds upon the observation that blockchains are rarely subject to benign faults. As opposed to probabilistic blockchains, LLB solves consensus deterministically when {\$}f{\textless}n/3{\$}. As opposed to Byzantine fault tolerant blockchains, it resolves a series of disagreements by reducing eventually the number of deceitful replicas from {\$}n/3\leq f{\textless}2n/3{\$} to {\$}f'{\textless}n'/3{\$} among a new set of {\$}n'{\$} replicas. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we implement two coalition attacks and a zero loss payment application that forces replicas that misbehave to reimburse conflicting transactions. Finally, LLB outperforms the raw state machine replication at the heart of Facebook's Libra and achieves performance comparable to a scalable blockchain that cannot tolerate {\$}n/3{\$} failures.},

@article{Cachin.2017,
 abstract = {A blockchain is a distributed ledger for recording transactions, maintained by many nodes without central authority through a distributed cryptographic protocol. All nodes validate the information to be appended to the blockchain, and a consensus protocol ensures that the nodes agree on a unique order in which entries are appended. Consensus protocols for tolerating Byzantine faults have received renewed attention because they also address blockchain systems. This work discusses the process of assessing and gaining confidence in the resilience of a consensus protocols exposed to faults and adversarial nodes. We advocate to follow the established practice in cryptography and computer security, relying on public reviews, detailed models, and formal proofs; the designers of several practical systems appear to be unaware of this. Moreover, we review the consensus protocols in some prominent permissioned blockchain platforms with respect to their fault models and resilience against attacks. The protocol comparison covers Hyperledger Fabric, Tendermint, Symbiont, R3{\~{}}Corda, Iroha, Kadena, Chain, Quorum, MultiChain, Sawtooth Lake, Ripple, Stellar, and IOTA.},

@misc{Greenspan.2015,
 abstract = {The Bitcoin cryptocurrency records its transactions in a public log called the blockchain. Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, i.e., it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed.  We show that the Bitcoin protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners obtain a revenue larger than their fair share. This attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the selfish miners, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency.  Selfish mining is feasible for any group size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects against selfish mining pools that command less than 1/4 of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/2 bound, but better than the current reality where a group of any size can compromise the system.},

@misc{Courtois.2014,
 abstract = {In this paper we revisit some major orthodoxies which lie at the heart of the bitcoin crypto currency and its numerous clones. In particular we look at The Longest Chain Rule, the monetary supply policies and the exact mechanisms which implement them. We claim that these built-in properties are not as brilliant as they are sometimes claimed. A closer examination reveals that they are closer to being... engineering mistakes which other crypto currencies have copied rather blindly. More precisely we show that the capacity of current crypto currencies to resist double spending attacks is poor and most current crypto currencies are highly vulnerable. Satoshi did not implement a timestamp for bitcoin transactions and the bitcoin software does not attempt to monitor double spending events. As a result major attacks involving hundreds of millions of dollars can occur and would not even be recorded. Hundreds of millions have been invested to pay for ASIC hashing infrastructure yet insufficient attention was paid to network neutrality and to insure that the protection layer it promises is effective and cannot be abused. In this paper we develop a theory of Programmed Self-Destruction of crypto currencies. We observe that most crypto currencies have mandated abrupt and sudden transitions. These affect their hash rate and therefore their protection against double spending attacks which we do not limit the to the notion of 51{\%} attacks which is highly misleading. In addition we show that smaller bitcoin competitors are substantially more vulnerable. In addition to small hash rate, many bitcoin competitors mandate incredibly important adjustments in miner reward. We exhibit examples of 'alt-coins' which validate our theory and for which the process of programmed decline and rapid self-destruction has clearly already started.},

 abstract = {The novel, yet disruptive blockchain technology has witnessed growing attention, due to its intrinsic potential. Besides the conventional domains that benefit from such potential, such as finance, supply chain and healthcare, blockchain use cases in software engineering have emerged recently. In this study, we aim to contribute to the body of knowledge of blockchain-oriented software engineering by providing an adequate overview of the software engineering applications enabled by blockchain technology. To do so, we carried out a systematic mapping study and identified 22 primary studies. Then, we extracted data within the research type, research topic and contribution type facets. Findings suggest an increasing trend of studies since 2018. Additionally, findings reveal the potential of using blockchain technologies as an alternative to centralized systems, such as GitHub, Travis CI, and cloud-based package managers, and also to establish trust between parties in collaborative software development. We also found out that smart contracts can enable the automation of a variety of software engineering activities that usually require human reasoning, such as the acceptance phase, payments to software engineers, and compliance adherence. In spite of the fact that the field is not yet mature, we believe that this systematic mapping study provides a holistic overview that may benefit researchers interested in bringing blockchain to the software industry, and practitioners willing to understand how blockchain can transform the software development industry.},
