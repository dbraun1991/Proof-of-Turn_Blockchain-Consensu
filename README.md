Proof-of-Turn: Blockchain consensus using a round-robin procedure as one possible solution for cutting costs in mobile games

## Abstract

> This master thesis deals with Blockchain Technology in mobile turn based peer to peer games. First, it investigates the capabilities of Blockchain Technology to be used for gaming applications. In this regard, among others, Proof-of-Mechanisms, Vote-based Consensus and several Performance Improvements are described. Second, several smart contracts are introduced to show the general feasibility of turn based games hosted on Blockchain Technology. More specific, Hidden transactions, Randomization, Piles of Cards, Fog of War elements, Data allocation improvements and other smart contracts are specified. Third, a special Proof-of-Turn consensus mechanism, based on the Blockchain Technology, is defined to enable game publishers to cut costs in the means of their provided game servers. Herein, Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Peering, the CAP Theorem, Interoperability among other characteristics are covered. Last, these measures shall additionally raise the trust level among the players in mobile turn based games.


## History

The thesis was crafted in 2021.

After some cooldown, it was submitted in 2023 on [https://arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07384).

This Repository mirrors the knowledge from 2023.


## Aim

Whilst this repository shall only save the konwledge, a sample implementations shall follow.
